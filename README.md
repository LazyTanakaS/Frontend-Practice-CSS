## üöÄ Quick Start

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LazyTanakaS/Frontend-Practice-CSS.git
cd Frontend-Practice-CSS
```

### Open any project

```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd flexbox-cards  # or grid-landing, loader-animation, ai-tech-landing

# Option 1: Open directly in browser
open index.html

# Option 2: Use VS Code Live Server
code .
# Then right-click index.html ‚Üí "Open with Live Server"

# Option 3: Use local server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

### HTML

- ‚úÖ Single `h1` element exists on the page to define the main title
- ‚úÖ Card titles use `h2`/`h3` for proper heading hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Semantic structure: each card is marked up as an `article` (or list item)
- ‚úÖ Images have proper `alt` text ‚Äî descriptive for portraits, empty for decorative ones
- ‚úÖ Images have fixed dimensions or `aspect-ratio` to prevent layout shifts (CLS)

### CSS

- ‚úÖ Smooth hover effect with slight scale (`1.03‚Äì1.05`) and soft shadow, without moving other elements
- ‚úÖ Visible focus state (`:focus-visible`) for keyboard navigation
- ‚úÖ Responsive layout: no horizontal scroll or broken text on small screens (320‚Äì360 px)

### Performance

- ‚úÖ Compressed images (WebP/AVIF) for faster load and better performance
- ‚úÖ Contrast meets accessibility guidelines (WCAG ‚â• 4.5:1)
- ‚úÖ Lighthouse scores ‚â• 90 for Accessibility and Best Practices

All screenshots and Lighthouse reports are stored under `/docs/screenshots`.
